## About the Project

Group 6 presents **Spacer** as our Full Stack Capstone. This project uses **React (frontend)** and **Flask (backend)** to build a real-world application for managing space rentals. From booking shared offices to managing listings and payments, Spacer helps bring clients and owners together on a single platform.

---

##  Project Statement

Managing space rentals manually is inefficient and lacks scalability. Spacer aims to simplify that by offering a digital solution that:

- Allows users to **find and book** spaces easily
- Enables owners to **list, update, and manage** their spaces
- Provides both parties with **notifications** and **payment management**

---

##  Objectives

- Build a responsive and accessible frontend with React and Tailwind CSS  
- Implement JWT authentication with proper access control  
- Display listings and booking functionality for clients  
- Provide owner dashboards for managing spaces, bookings, and payments  
- Connect the frontend to a RESTful Flask API

---

## Project Scope

This frontend application will:

- Register/Login users (client and owner roles)
- Allow clients to browse and book available spaces
- Allow owners to create/edit/delete spaces
- Display and update payment and booking statuses
- Provide toast notifications for actions
- Handle protected routes and session persistence

---

## System Architecture


- **Pages**: React Router for client and owner dashboards  
- **Auth**: JWT stored in localStorage  
- **State**: useState/useEffect for dynamic data handling  
- **Notifications**: Toasts for feedback on all user actions  

---

## Technologies Used

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router DOM
- React Toastify
- JWT for authentication
- Fetch API for backend communication
- Deployed via Vercel
